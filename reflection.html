    <h3><Strong>REFLECTION</Strong></h3>
    <div class="text-container">
    <p>How do you think my website design? In my work, I have carefully designed the page by dividing it into three columns, focusing on reflection, typography, and CARP posters. Each column contains different materials and reference links. My goal was to create a clear and visually appealing design that allows the audience to understand my various projects.</p>
    <p>When it comes to inspiration, I must say that I draw inspiration from the design of the Spotify webpage at https://spotify.design/. I truly admire its vibrant and well-organized layout. I hope that I can become a skilled designer capable of designing such remarkable designs in the future. Visual appeal is essential to me, so I incorporated drawing patterns with ".png" files in different sections of my design, just like the Spotify website. Furthermore, I have added personal elements such as my Instagram media content, audio sound, email, and contact number to elevate the overall professionalism of the final result.</p>
    <p> Initially, I deviated from following the coding worksheets and instead took the time to review them and make notes. This approach aligns with my learning style, which focuses on achieving the desired result but sometimes overlooks the process. However, I soon realized that merely observing the worksheets without completing them was not sufficient to fully grasp the learning experience. I came to understand that it would be "not sustainable to learn to run before learning to walk". Therefore, at the beginning of November, I made the decision to pause my work on the website design and commit to completing the worksheets step by step. This adjustment has undoubtedly led to improvements in both the speed and presentation of my code, resulting in a more refined design.</p>
    <p> Lastly, I would like to discuss a theory of finding a balance between overconfidence and fear. Initially, I experienced immense frustration as I made repeated mistakes, particularly with the use of flexbox. This frustration may have been caused by my excessive self-confidence at the start of my project. However, I soon realized the importance of being patient and taking a step-by-step approach to my work. Now, I am proud to say that the final outcome of my efforts is a testament to the growth and progress I have achieved. Through a combination of self-reflection, adjusting my approach, and persevering through challenges, I have found a balance that allows me to tackle projects with confidence while remaining open to learning and growth.</p>
