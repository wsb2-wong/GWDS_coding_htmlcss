    <h3><Strong>REFLECTION</Strong></h3>
    <div class="text-container">
        <p>How do you think my website design? In my work, I have carefully designed the page by dividing it into four columns, focusing on reflection, practice worksheets ,  typography and CARP posters. My goal was to create a clear and visually appealing design that allows the audience to understand my various projects. At the footer part, I have include some daily useful websites and materials for poster and website design. It is a small corner for myself to click and get inspirations , I believe the more I watch , the bigger the chance to design a perfect artwork. </p>
        <p>In the reflection on inspiration, I find the design of the Spotify webpage at https://spotify.design/ to be particularly influential (Spotify, n.d.). I truly admire its colorful drawings and well-organized layout. I hope that I can become a skillful designer who are capable of designing such remarkable designs in the future. Visual appeal is essential to me, so I incorporated drawing patterns with "png files‚Äù in different sections of my design, just like the Spotify website. Furthermore, I have added personal elements such as my Instagram media content, audio sound, email, and contact number to elevate the overall professionalism of the final result.</p>
        <p>Initially, I deviated from following the coding worksheets and instead took the time to review them and make notes. This approach aligns with my learning style, which focuses on achieving the desired result ( hand the assignment ) but sometimes overlooks the process. However, I soon realized that merely observing the worksheets without completing them was not sufficient to fully grasp the learning experience. I came to understand that it would be "not sustainable to learn to run before learning to walk". Therefore, at the beginning of November, I made the decision to pause my work on the website design and commit to completing the worksheets step by step. This adjustment has undoubtedly led to improvements in both the speed and presentation of my code, resulting in a more refined design.</p>
        <p>After spending time in practice, I've honed several key typing habits. for instance, opting for "min-height" over fixed height 
          and embraced the versatility of Flexbox in every coding session. 
          By reading and trying different kinds of color, I have discovered the magic of both contrast and similarity. On my website, I opted for a similar red and pink color, while simultaneously using the contrasting black and white.
          Moreover, adding buttons and playing with cursor effects brought a fresh layer of interest to my design endeavors.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I would like to discuss a theory of finding a balance between overconfidence and fear. Initially, I experienced immense frustration as I made repeated mistakes, particularly with the use of flexbox. This frustration may have been caused by my excessive self-confidence at the start of my project. However, I soon realized the importance of being patient and taking a step-by-step approach to my work. Now, I am proud to say that the final outcome of my efforts is a testament to the growth and progress I have achieved. Through a combination of self-reflection, adjusting my approach, and persevering through challenges, I have found a balance that allows me to tackle projects with confidence while remaining open to learning and growth.</p>
