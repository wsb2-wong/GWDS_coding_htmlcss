            <p>AXIAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS divides everything by an imaginary line, it may be simple and look boring, but the axis is used to help from grouping. In my design, I have incorporated two distinct directions to follow. Additionally, doubling the theme's words aims to enhance the canvas's visual appeal. Moreover, I have adjusted the date's size to leave a lasting impression on viewers.</p>

            <p>RADIO TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS creates a point of focus. In my design, the central theme serves as the focal point, with other elements extending from it. Do you think that the overall effect like a sun and the sunlight?  The inclusion of rectangles adds texture to the work intentionally</p>

            <p>DILATATIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS is similar with radio typographic system , but the difference is the text are form with curves around a point.
              . In my design, I make the elements like movement of sound waves . Although the curves is not perfect enough, I hope I did make a sense of motion!

            <p>RANDOM TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS organized the elements randomly devoid of aim, pattern or direction. Initially, my design is suggested to embraced greater randomness,
              , because there is still a flow between the wordings. After that, I attempted to break through, making things more messy by adding curves, drawing lines and shadow. However, I hope the information are still clear enough for the audience to read, especially the theme and the date.

            <p>GRID TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS divides the page into columns and rows. In my design, I incorporated a striking line using two contrasting colors, black and red. However, I went beyond the simplicity of six columns by adding additional lines to infuse style into my work, is there a sense of extension from left to right? particularly in the middle section.</p>

            <p>MODULAR TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS divides elements into distinct boxes, resulting in a neat arrangement of words. From my perspective, this system is reminiscent of what is commonly seen in textbooks.
              In my design, I make various circles to encapsulate different parts of words. To enhance the overall aesthetic, words are not follow the size of circle.

            <p>TRANSITIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS defined by the layering of lines of text into informal textured planes and shifting tonal bands. In my design, I make an up and down flow which likes a mountain . Additionally, the white rectangles serve as the guiding element, visually illustrating the flow and adding a sense of structure to the composition.</p>

            <p>BILATERAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS embody the art of symmetrical text arrangement, creating a harmonious balance along a single axis.
              In my design, I add the circles on the four corner at the same way which makes the picture more balance. More than that, to elevate the theme further, I have skillfully employed immersive 3D effects.</p>
