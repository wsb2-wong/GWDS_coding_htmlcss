    <h3><Strong>REFLECTION</Strong></h3>
    <img src="other image/little star.png">
    <p>How do you think my website design? In my work, I have carefully designed the page by dividing it into four columns, focusing on reflection, practice worksheets ,  typography and CARP posters. My goal was to create a clear and visually appealing design that allows the audience to understand my various projects. At the footer part, I have include some daily useful websites and materials for poster and website design. It is a small corner for myself to click and get inspirations , I believe the more I watch , the bigger the chance to design a perfect artwork. </p>
    <p>In the reflection on inspiration, I find the design of the Spotify webpage at https://spotify.design/ to be particularly influential (Spotify, n.d.). I truly admire its colorful drawings and well-organized layout. I hope that I can become a skillful designer who are capable of designing such remarkable designs in the future. Visual appeal is essential to me, so I incorporated drawing patterns with "png files‚Äù in different sections of my design, just like the Spotify website. Furthermore, I have added personal elements such as my Instagram media content, audio sound, email, and contact number to elevate the overall professionalism of the final result.</p>
    <p>Initially, I deviated from following the coding worksheets and instead took the time to review them and make notes. This approach aligns with my learning style, which focuses on achieving the desired result ( hand the assignment ) but sometimes overlooks the process. However, I soon realized that merely observing the worksheets without completing them was not sufficient to fully grasp the learning experience. I came to understand that it would be "not sustainable to learn to run before learning to walk". Therefore, at the beginning of November, I made the decision to pause my work on the website design and commit to completing the worksheets step by step. This adjustment has undoubtedly led to improvements in both the speed and presentation of my code, resulting in a more refined design.</p>
    <p>After spending time in practice, I've honed several key typing habits. for instance, opting for "min-height" over fixed height 
      and embraced the versatility of Flexbox in every coding session. 
      By reading and trying different kinds of color, I have discovered the magic of both contrast and similarity. On my website, I opted for a similar red and pink color, while simultaneously using the contrasting black and white.
      Moreover, adding buttons and playing with cursor effects brought a fresh layer of interest to my design endeavors.</p>
      <p>Lastly, I would like to discuss a theory of finding a balance between overconfidence and fear. Initially, I experienced immense frustration as I made repeated mistakes, particularly with the use of flexbox. This frustration may have been caused by my excessive self-confidence at the start of my project. However, I soon realized the importance of being patient and taking a step-by-step approach to my work. Now, I am proud to say that the final outcome of my efforts is a testament to the growth and progress I have achieved. Through a combination of self-reflection, adjusting my approach, and persevering through challenges, I have found a balance that allows me to tackle projects with confidence while remaining open to learning and growth.</p>

        <p>AXIAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS divides everything by an imaginary line, it may be simple and look boring, but the axis is used to help from grouping. In my design, I have incorporated two distinct directions to follow. Additionally, doubling the theme's words aims to enhance the canvas's visual appeal. Moreover, I have adjusted the date's size to leave a lasting impression on viewers.</p>

        <p>RADIO TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS creates a point of focus. In my design, the central theme serves as the focal point, with other elements extending from it. Do you think that the overall effect like a sun and the sunlight?  The inclusion of rectangles adds texture to the work intentionally</p>

        <p>DILATATIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS is similar with radio typographic system , but the difference is the text are form with curves around a point.
          . In my design, I make the elements like movement of sound waves . Although the curves is not perfect enough, I hope I did make a sense of motion!

        <p>RANDOM TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS organized the elements randomly devoid of aim, pattern or direction. Initially, my design is suggested to embraced greater randomness,
          , because there is still a flow between the wordings. After that, I attempted to break through, making things more messy by adding curves, drawing lines and shadow. However, I hope the information are still clear enough for the audience to read, especially the theme and the date.

However, I went beyond the simplicity of six columns by adding additional lines to infuse style into my work, is there a sense of extension from left to right? particularly in the middle section.</p>

        <p>MODULAR TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS divides elements into distinct boxes, resulting in a neat arrangement of words. From my perspective, this system is reminiscent of what is commonly seen in textbooks.
          In my design, I make various circles to encapsulate different parts of words. To enhance the overall aesthetic, words are not follow the size of circle.

        <p>TRANSITIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS defined by the layering of lines of text into informal textured planes and shifting tonal bands.

        <p>BILATERAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS embody the art of symmetrical text arrangement, creating a harmonious balance along a single axis.
          In my design, I add the circles on the four corner at the same way which makes the picture more balance. More than that, to elevate the theme further, I have skillfully employed immersive 3D effects.</p>

      <p>In this poster, the central focus is on the people, surrounded by repeated words on both sides. Next, I've organized the content into a central column, creating an information bar within a green box. However, to enhance visual interest, I strategically placed the date, time, and venue in separate locations on the poster. The application of Transitional typographic systems in the middle adds a dynamic touch, effectively showcasing the date and time. The informal typeface of the title contributes to an overall youthful and energetic vibe.</p>

          <p>In this poster, I've incorporated the principles of Axial Typographic Systems. The utilization of two axials adds a dynamic quality to the design, creating an organized arrangement.

            To enhance the visual richness while maintaining order, I've repeated circles along one of the axial directions, contributing to a layered and tidy background.
            
            For a more prominent title, I've applied an outline and  the shadow to the circle in the middle, creating a 3D effect on the words. Not only does this emphasizes the title but also adds depth to the overall composition.

            <p>I've replicated the style of the first poster by placing the title at the top with the same typeface. However, in this design, I've adopted a bilateral typographic system, 
              
              with words positioned on both sides and a central circle featuring a 3D effect theme. To maintain a clean and standardized appearance, I've used layers to cover the people in the image. The focal point of the poster is the center, where key information such as the date, venue, time, and price, which is displayed with a large font size, is easy to watch.</p>
