   <p>"Hello , i am a student who is studying digital media in UWE now.<br>
      Web and Graphic Design, along with the Media Studio class, have been my favorite modules in Year 1, especially when combined with coding and 3D environments.<br>
      While I may not excel in computer science and mathematics, finding coding and logic challenging , haha.<br>
      Until now, i am feeling a bit confused of what job can i found as i could not perform well in some modules. <br>
      BUT...lets talk about web and graphic design lesson, the process of creating websites and posters in the Web and Graphic Design lessons is truly enjoyable.<br>
      I appreciate the freedom to design without the constraints of complex math. Completing each project brings a sense of accomplishment and adds to the enjoyment of these creative pursuits."" <br>
