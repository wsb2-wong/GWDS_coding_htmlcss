            <p>In this poster, the central focus is on the people, surrounded by repeated words on both sides. Next, I've organized the content into a central column, creating an information bar within a green box. However, to enhance visual interest, I strategically placed the date, time, and venue in separate locations on the poster. The application of Transitional typographic systems in the middle adds a dynamic touch, effectively showcasing the date and time. The informal typeface of the title contributes to an overall youthful and energetic vibe.</p>

            <p>In this poster, I've incorporated the principles of Axial Typographic Systems. The utilization of two axials adds a dynamic quality to the design, creating an organized arrangement.

                To enhance the visual richness while maintaining order, I've repeated circles along one of the axial directions, contributing to a layered and tidy background.
                
                For a more prominent title, I've applied an outline and  the shadow to the circle in the middle, creating a 3D effect on the words. Not only does this emphasizes the title but also adds depth to the overall composition.</p>

            <p>I've replicated the style of the first poster by placing the title at the top with the same typeface. However, in this design, I've adopted a bilateral typographic system, with words positioned on both sides and a central circle featuring a 3D effect theme. To maintain a clean and standardized appearance, I've used layers to cover the people in the image. The focal point of the poster is the center, where key information such as the date, venue, time, and price which displayed with a large font size are easy to watch. </p>
